Q: The node definition of double link list is as following:
typedef struct node
{
    int date;
    struct node *front, *next;
}TNode;

There are two double list. A and B, and their head pointer is pHeadA, pHeadB.
The data member in all nodes of A is difference. The data member in all nodes of
B is difference, either.

Please write a function to delete  all the nodes with same data value in A and B.
